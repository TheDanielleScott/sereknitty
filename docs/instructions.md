## Build instructions
{: menu="Build" }

1. Make sure that you have a Google account and that it is registered as a tester with the developer.
2. Make sure that you have a Github account.
3. Have IntelliJ IDEA installed on your computer.
4. Have a smart phone or tablet with an Android OS installed from API 28 (Android 9) or later.
4. Go to [Sereknitty's Github Repository](https://github.com/ddc-java-17/sereknitty-thedaniellescott) at https://github.com/ddc-java-17/sereknitty-thedaniellescott
5. Click on the green `Code` button in the upper right hand side of the screen, and copy the link to clone the repository.
6. Open IntelliJ IDEA and click on `Get from VCS`. This will open a dialogue window. Paste the link from Github into the URL field and click the `Clone` button.
7. IntelliJ IDEA should open the project immediately after downloading. If it doesn't open on its own, open the project from the IntelliJ IDEA Welcome screen.
8. Plug your phone or tablet into your computer, and run the app from IntelliJ. IntelliJ will automatically download and install the app.


## User instructions
{: menu="User" }

When Sereknitty opens and after you sign in, it will automatically open to the Pattern Library. Tap the floating button with a "+" to open the Pattern Builder (it doesn't to anything yet). Tap a pattern in the Pattern Library to open that pattern in the Pattern Reader (will show the pattern and nothing more).

To get to the Settings, tap the meatballs in the upper right on the Action Bar to open the drawer, and then tap "Settings". To sign out, open the same drawer menu and tap sign out.
