## Completion state
{: menu="Completion" }

## Known deficiencies
{: menu="Deficiencies" }

The app has no way to add data except to add it to the database directly. The solution is to finish the Pattern Builder Fragment that would allow the user to enter in patterns manually.

Sereknitty is not yet capable of allowing users to take pictures of their patterns and save them. The plan is to implement the Camera button in the Action Bar on the Pattern Reader Fragment so the user can tap that and snap a picture of the current pattern.

There is a distinct lack of preferences in this app. I plan to implement a Dark Mode setting, in addition to a Text and Symbol Size setting for knitters with poor eyesight.



## Test environments used
{: menu="Environments" }

This app has been tested on a Samsung Galaxy S24 phone (Android Version 14, API 34).
